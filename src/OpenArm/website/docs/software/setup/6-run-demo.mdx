# Step 6: Hands-On: Demo Run

Now that your basic communication is working, let's run the full OpenArm demo program to test complete system functionality.
More details for control can be found [here](../can).

## Prerequisites

Before running the demo, verify these prerequisites are complete:
- ✅ Motor IDs configured and tested (Steps 1, 3)
- ✅ CAN interface configured (Step 2)
- ✅ OpenArm CAN library built (Step 4)
- ✅ Motor zero position set to safe values, baudrate matches CAN interface configuration (Step 5)

:::danger ⚠️ READ BEFORE RUNNING DEMO ⚠️

- **ZERO POSITION**: Ensure you have set safe zero positions for all motors
- **EMERGENCY STOP**: Keep emergency stop button within immediate reach at ALL times
- **CLEAR WORKSPACE**: Remove ALL obstacles, tools, and personnel from arm movement area
- **POWER DISCONNECT**: Know how to quickly disconnect power if needed

**Failure to follow these safety requirements may result in serious injury or equipment damage.**
:::



Connect the motors in a daisy-chain using XT30 2+2 cables. [See detailed wiring instructions →](/hardware/wiring-and-casing-guide/components)

The default demo uses motors 0x01, 0x02, 0x07 (DM4310) on CAN0 with CANFD. If your setup matches, run directly:

```bash
./build/openarm-demo
```

## Configure the Demo

Configured with your specific motor setup by editing `openarm_can/examples` and rebuild if needed.
Find and update these sections to match your motor setup:

```cpp
// Initialize arm motors
std::vector<openarm::damiao_motor::MotorType> motor_types = {
    openarm::damiao_motor::MotorType::DM4310,
    openarm::damiao_motor::MotorType::DM4310
};
std::vector<uint32_t> send_can_ids = {0x01, 0x02};  // Your motor send IDs
std::vector<uint32_t> recv_can_ids = {0x11, 0x12};  // Your motor receive IDs
```

**Example configurations:**

**7-motor arm:**
```cpp
std::vector<openarm::damiao_motor::MotorType> motor_types = {
    openarm::damiao_motor::MotorType::DM8009,
    openarm::damiao_motor::MotorType::DM8009,
    openarm::damiao_motor::MotorType::DM4340,
    openarm::damiao_motor::MotorType::DM4340,
    openarm::damiao_motor::MotorType::DM4310,
    openarm::damiao_motor::MotorType::DM4310,
    openarm::damiao_motor::MotorType::DM4310
};
std::vector<uint32_t> send_can_ids = {0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07};
std::vector<uint32_t> recv_can_ids = {0x11, 0x12, 0x13, 0x14, 0x15, 0x16, 0x17};
```

:::warning
Ensure all three vectors (motor_types, send_can_ids, recv_can_ids) have the same length to avoid undefined behavior.
:::


**gripper**

If you have a gripper, update the gripper configuration. Otherwise, remove all code using the gripper.

```cpp
// Initialize gripper
openarm.init_gripper_motor(openarm::damiao_motor::MotorType::DM4310, 0x08, 0x18);
```


## What the Demo Does

The demo program performs these operations:

1. **Initialization**: Sets up CAN interface and motor communication
2. **Motor Query**: Reads and displays motor IDs to verify configuration
3. **Motor Control**:
   - Enables all motors
   - Performs position control tests
   - Performs torque control tests
4. **Gripper Control**: Opens and closes the gripper (if configured)
5. **Status Monitoring**: Displays motor positions for 10 cycles
6. **Cleanup**: Safely disables all motors

Modify the configuration as needed for your setup.

## Rebuild the Demo

After modifying the configuration, rebuild the demo:

```bash
cmake --build build --target openarm-demo
```

## Run the Demo

```bash
cd build
./openarm-demo
```

## Expected Output

You should see output similar to:

```
=== OpenArm CAN Example ===
This example demonstrates the OpenArm API functionality
Initializing OpenArm CAN...
Initializing gripper...

=== Enabling Motors ===

=== Querying Motor Recv IDs ===
Arm Motor: 1 ID: 17
Arm Motor: 2 ID: 18
Gripper Motor: 8 ID: 24

=== Controlling Motors ===

Arm Motor: 1 position: 0.123
Arm Motor: 2 position: 0.456
Gripper Motor: 8 position: 0.789
...
```

## Troubleshooting

- Use `candump` to monitor CAN communication
- Verify motor power supply (24V)
- Check cable connections (especially for daisy-chained setups)


## What's Next

Congrats! You have completed the basic setup.
If the demo runs successfully, you can now develop custom applications using the OpenArm API or try ROS2 integration.
