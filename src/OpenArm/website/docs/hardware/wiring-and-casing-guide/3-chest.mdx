# 3. Chest Wiring & Casing

This section covers installing the hub boards, connecting all cables, and closing the chest cover.

## Steps

1. [Hub Board Installation](#1-hub-board-installation)
2. [Hub Board Connection](#2-hub-board-connection)
3. [Chest Cover Installation](#3-chest-cover-installation)

## 1. Hub Board Installation

For a list of components with photos, see section [0. Components](./0-components.mdx).

1. Insert the HNTP6-6 T-slot nuts into the slots at the back of each shoulder.
2. Attach the hub board back cover and hub board PCB using cap screws. Position the CAN connectors facing inward (toward the center of the body).
3. Tighten all cap screws securely.
