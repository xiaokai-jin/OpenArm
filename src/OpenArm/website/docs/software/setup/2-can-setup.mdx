# Step 2: Setup SocketCAN Interface

Configure your CAN interface to communicate with the OpenArm motors. This step sets up SocketCAN on Linux to enable CAN bus communication.
The [electrical BOM](/hardware/bill-of-materials/electrical) contains the device we are using for experiments.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the required tools installed:

```bash
sudo apt install can-utils iproute2
```

## Find Your CAN Interface

First, identify your CAN interface device. List network interfaces to find your CAN adapter and look for interfaces like can0, can1, slcan0, etc.

```bash
ip link show
```

## Setup the interface

Replace `can0` with your actual CAN interface name and use a baudrate supported by you interfaces for the steps.

### Option 1: setup manually

**CAN 2.0 Mode**

```bash
sudo ip link set can0 down
# configure CAN 2.0 with 1mbps
sudo ip link set can0 type can bitrate 1000000
sudo ip link set can0 up
```

**CAN FD Mode**
```bash
ip link set can0 down
# configure CAN FD with 5mbps
sudo ip link set can0 type can bitrate 1000000 dbitrate 5000000 fd on
sudo ip link set can0 up
```

### Option 2: use setup scripts

The OpenArm CAN library includes convenient setup scripts, example usage:

```bash
# Navigate to openarm_can directory
git clone https://github.com/enactic/openarm_can.git
cd openarm_can/setup

# For CAN 2.0
./configure_socketcan.sh can0

# For CAN FD at 5mbps (recommended)
./configure_socketcan.sh can0 -fd -b 1000000 -d 5000000
```

## Verify Configuration

Check that your CAN interface is properly configured:

```bash
# Verify interface is up and running
ip link show can0

# Monitor CAN traffic (optional)
candump can0

# Test monitoring
cansend can0 ...
```

## Troubleshooting

If the interface configuration fails:

- Verify physical connections
- Verify driver installation for your specific CAN adapter
- Check `dmesg` for device logs
- Some serial based devices may need wrappers like `slcand` to be visible in `ip link show`
- Check supported bitrate values and device compatibility
- Load kernel modules like
  ```
  sudo modprobe slcan
  sudo modprobe can
  sudo modprobe can_raw
  ```
