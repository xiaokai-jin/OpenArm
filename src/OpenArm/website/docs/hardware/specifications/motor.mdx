# Motor Specifications

## Motor Location

OpenArm uses the DAMIAO 43 series and DAMIAO 8009P motors.
To efficiently achieve high payload capacity, different motors are selected for each joint from the shoulder to the end-effector.
To ensure greater rigidity and precision, motors equipped with cross-roller bearings are used in sections supported on one side.
Although the DAMIAO 4340 series is not a QDD motor, it was chosen to balance high payload capacity with a clean, compact appearance.

:::warning
📌 Note: While the linked datasheet is for the DM8009 model, the actual motor used in our arms is the DM8009P. The specifications of both models are nearly identical, and for all practical purposes, the DM8009 datasheet provides an accurate reference for evaluating the motor's performance and compatibility.
