# Isaac Lab Simulation

## 🧠 Overview

Welcome to the **OpenArm Isaac Lab Simulation Documentation**.

We are developing **reinforcement learning (RL)** and **imitation learning (IL)** applications using the **OpenArm** model in the **Isaac Sim / Isaac Lab** environment.
Our goal is to enable simple simulation, robust learning, and seamless **Sim2Real transfer** for robotic manipulation tasks.

All code will be released as **open source**.

## 🎥 Demo Videos

Explore the performance of our OpenArm in three RL tasks:

* **Reaching Task**

## 🚧 Coming Soon...

We are actively working on:

* 🧠 Reinforcement Learning Code
* 🤖 Imitation Learning Code
* 🔄 Sim2Real Transfer Code

Stay tuned for updates!
