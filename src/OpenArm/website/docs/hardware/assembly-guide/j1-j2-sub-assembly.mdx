# Step 2: J1-J2 Sub-Assembly

1. Attach the rear of the `J1` motor to `J1_A` with 5 `M4x10` bolts. Ensure the power and communication ports remain accessible. Ensure that this motor has been configured to have `ID:0x01` and `Master ID:0x11`

2. Attach `J1_B` to the motor using 3 `M4x8` bolts. The mechanical stop should face the motor’s power port and be on the top side. Refer to the image for clarity.

:::tip
For the left arm assembly, part `J1_B` must be oriented slightly differently. Please refer to the image for the correct orientation. All other steps remain unchanged. Ensure that the Power+CAN ports on the J1 motor face forward, with the mechanical stop positioned toward the ports and at the top.

3. Attach the `J1_C` part to the rotor of `J1` using 6 `M5x10` bolts

5. Attach `J1_E` to `J1_C` using 3 `M4x10` bolts

6. Carefully insert the DM8009 motor `J2` between `J1_D` and `J1_E`, with the ports facing directly toward `J1`. The rear of `J2` should face `J1_E`. Join `J1_E` to `J2` motor using 2 `M4x8` bolts
